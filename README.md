# taskbot

taskbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

## To Do's

### Doing

- Get confirmation of messages being sent/received
- Verify bot interaction in Slack Channels and Groups
(will probably need to change from `hear` to `respond`?)

### Done


### Finished
- Correctly send attachments from Zendesk to Slack
- Implement "satisfied with care" for a given task
- Improve Bot's messages to design User Flow
  - Add intro first time message "Hi, this is how you use me"
  - Add "Working hard right now..."

- Implement "Waiting" user flow

- Integrate Parse to save all conversation
- Integrate Keen io for Analytics

### Backlog

- Make bot work in Channels (means multiple users can create 1 task)
- First time show instructions on how to use (commands)

- Implement help function that shows commands

- Add tests
- Automate testing
- Automate deployment
- Let two tasks be created at same time.

- Check tone of task (urgent or normal)
- Permit more complex and accurate user interactions (not happy with work, complaint)
  - Vary questions depending on design task (infograph, presentation)

- Emergency real person chatting override
- Bot learns about users. Ability learning curve (teaches new functionalities after some time)

- Have memory of history of tasks (taskbot get me the history)
- Learn about users and teams (brands, preferences...)

- Progressive mastery design (while users learn to use taskbot, more features are unlocked)

- Implement dynamic conversations with SETS of messages
- Schedule repeating Tasks ("Taskbot I will need conversion images every Tuesday")

### Running taskbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start taskbot locally by running:

    % HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-8449788979-T3av6Q6gHKNUXMKZG0fI0Z5X ./bin/hubot --adapter slack
